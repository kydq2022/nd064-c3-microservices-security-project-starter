Test Environment Setup
- Set up a test environment resembling the production Kubernetes cluster.

Hardening Changes
- Implement hardening changes (e.g., RBAC, network policies) in the test environment.

Functional Tests
- Verify basic Kubernetes functionalities and application deployment.

Backup
- Take a complete backup of the Kubernetes cluster and critical data.

Rollback plan
- Test the rollback plan to ensure a smooth return to the pre-hardening state.

Goals:

- Confirm hardening doesn't disrupt normal operations.
- Ensure a rollback plan is effective.
- Validate security measures with scanning tools.
- Monitor for any anomalies.
