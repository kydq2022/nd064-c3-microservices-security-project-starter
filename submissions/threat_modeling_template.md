### **Docker Threat Modeling:**

1. **Spoofing Identity (S) - Unauthorized Access to Docker Host:**
   - *Threat:* An attacker may attempt to impersonate a legitimate user or service to gain unauthorized access to the Docker host.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as SSH keys or multi-factor authentication, to secure access to the Docker host.

2. **Tampering with Data (T) - Image and Container Integrity:**
   - *Threat:* Malicious actors may attempt to tamper with Docker images or containers to inject malicious code or compromise data integrity.
   - *Mitigation:* Ensure the use of signed images and employ integrity verification mechanisms to detect any unauthorized modifications to images or containers.

3. **Repudiation (R) - Unauthorized Image Deployment:**
   - *Threat:* A user may deploy unauthorized or malicious Docker images without leaving traces, making it difficult to trace the source of an attack.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement proper logging and monitoring to track image deployments, and restrict image sources to trusted repositories.

4. **Information Disclosure (I) - Container Breakout:**
   - *Threat:* Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to break out of containers and gain access to sensitive information on the host system.
   - *Mitigation:* Regularly update Docker to patch known vulnerabilities, use minimalistic base images, and employ container runtime security tools to prevent container breakouts.

5. **Denial of Service (D) - Resource Exhaustion:**
   - *Threat:* Malicious users may attempt to launch resource-intensive containers, leading to denial of service by consuming excessive system resources.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement resource quotas, monitor resource usage, and employ rate limiting to prevent containers from consuming excessive resources.

### **Kubernetes Threat Modeling:**

1. **Spoofing Identity (S) - Unauthorized Access to Kubernetes API:**
   - *Threat:* Attackers may attempt to impersonate legitimate users or services to gain unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and strong authentication mechanisms to control access to the Kubernetes API.

2. **Tampering with Data (T) - Pod and Cluster Configuration Tampering:**
   - *Threat:* Malicious actors may attempt to tamper with pod configurations or cluster settings to compromise the integrity of the Kubernetes environment.
   - *Mitigation:* Use Kubernetes network policies, implement PodSecurityPolicies, and regularly audit and review cluster configurations for any unauthorized changes.

3. **Repudiation (R) - Unauthorized Pod Creation:**
   - *Threat:* An attacker may deploy unauthorized pods without leaving traces, making it challenging to trace the origin of malicious activities.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement auditing and monitoring of pod creation events, and enforce policies to restrict pod deployments to trusted sources.

4. **Information Disclosure (I) - Insecure Communication Channels:**
   - *Threat:* Unencrypted communication channels between Kubernetes components may lead to information disclosure, as attackers can intercept sensitive data.
   - *Mitigation:* Enable and enforce TLS for communication between Kubernetes components, including the API server, etcd, and other control plane components.

5. **Denial of Service (D) - Resource Exhaustion and Pod Disruption:**
   - *Threat:* Malicious users may attempt to launch resource-intensive pods or disrupt existing pods, leading to denial of service or service degradation.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement resource quotas, use PodDisruptionBudgets, and monitor for abnormal resource usage to prevent and mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

# Docker Bench Security Findings:

## 2.15 - Ensure live restore is enabled (Scored)
- **Issue:** Live restore can pose security risks, allowing unauthorized access to running containers during daemon restarts.
- **Recommendation:** Consider the security implications and either enable or disable live restore based on your specific use case and security requirements.

## 2.16 - Ensure Userland Proxy is Disabled (Scored)
- **Issue:** Userland proxy can introduce security vulnerabilities; disabling it is recommended for improved security.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that Userland Proxy is disabled to mitigate potential security risks.

## 2.14 - Ensure containers are restricted from acquiring new privileges (Scored)
- **Issue:** Allowing containers to acquire new privileges can lead to security vulnerabilities and compromise the host system.
- **Recommendation:** Review and restrict container configurations to prevent them from acquiring new privileges, enhancing overall security.
