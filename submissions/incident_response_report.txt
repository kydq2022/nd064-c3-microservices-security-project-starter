Date: December 27, 2023

Incident Summary:
On December 27, 2023, at approximately 12:30 PM, a security incident occurred in our Kubernetes cluster. The incident involved the intentional execution of a suspicious command using the payload.sh script. This led to the introduction of malicious containers running crypto mining software and potentially exploiting security vulnerabilities in legacy Docker images.

Timeline of Events:
2. **December 27, 2023, 12:35 PM:** Suspicious command introduced into the Kubernetes cluster.
3. **December 27, 2023, 12:40 PM:** Containers instantiated with legacy Docker images, triggering crypto mining activities.
4. **December 27, 2023, 12:45 PM:** Detection of the incident by our security monitoring tools, including Falco.

Incident Analysis:
The incident involved the intentional deployment of containers with known security issues, posing risks such as crypto mining and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities. Our security monitoring tools, including Falco, played a crucial role in detecting and alerting us to the malicious activities promptly.

Response Actions:
1. **Immediate containment:** The affected containers were isolated and shut down promptly to prevent further impact.
2. **Analysis and investigation:** Our security team conducted a thorough investigation to assess the extent of the incident, identify affected resources, and understand the methods used by the attacker.
